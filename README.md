# Scheduler_OS
This lab implements a scheduler using DES (discrete event simulation) in C++. 

In DES, the system progresses in time through defining and executing the events,
and by progressing time discretely between the events as opposed to incrementing time continuously. 

Note that I maintain the state and statistics of the process in the PCB (process control block) object.
